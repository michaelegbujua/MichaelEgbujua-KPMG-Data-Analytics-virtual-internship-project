this is a little Journal of my KPMG Australia Data Analytics  Virtual Internship Final Project
This repository contains my submission for the Data Analytics Program offered by KPMG Australia, which is designed to teach individuals how to achieve business outcomes with the KPMG data analytics team.

#Task 01 - Data Quality Assessment
The task involved inspecting the quality of the data to prepare it for analysis. Using Microsoft Excel's Power Query, I identified issues and offered solutions through an email. The Data assessment includes: Completeness, Consistency, Relevance, Validity, accuracy, and currency.

#Task 02 - Data Exploration Presentation 
This Task involved explaining to the stakeholder the Data Exploration procedures  to achieve the analysis.This include: 
Data Exploration, Data Model and Interpretation

#Task 03 - Data Insights and Presentation
For the third task, I designed visualizations using PowerBI to drive insights gained from the data analysis. The visualization consists of  two dashboards (Transaction Analysis and Customer Demographics), the last pane on the dashboard is the recommendations gotten from the insights.
  
   
#Objectives
•	What are the trends in the underlying data?
•	Which customer segment has the highest customer value?
•	What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd ’s marketing and growth strategy?
•	What additional external datasets may be useful to obtain greater insights into customer preferences and propensity to purchase the products?
Specifically, the presentation should specify who Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s marketing team should be targeting out of the new 1000 customer list as well as the broader market 
segment to reach out to.
