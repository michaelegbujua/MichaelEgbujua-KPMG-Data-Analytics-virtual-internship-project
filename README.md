this is a little Journal of my KPMG Australia Data Analytics  Virtual Internship Final Project
This repository contains my submission for the Data Analytics Program offered by KPMG Australia, which is designed to teach individuals how to achieve business outcomes with the KPMG data analytics team.

#Task 01 - Data Quality Assessment
The task involved inspecting the quality of the data to prepare it for analysis. Using Microsoft Excel's Power Query, I identified issues and offered solutions through an email. The Data assessment includes: Completeness, Consistency, Relevance, Validity, accuracy, and currency.

#Task 02 - Data Exploration Presentation 
This Task involved explaining to the stakeholder the Data Exploration procedures  to achieve the analysis.This include: 
Data Exploration, Data Model and Interpretation

#Task 03 - Data Insights and Presentation
For the third task, I designed visualizations using PowerBI to drive insights gained from the data analysis. The visualization consist of  two dashboards (Transaction Analysis and Customer Demographics), the last pane on the dashboard is the recommendations gotten from the insights.
